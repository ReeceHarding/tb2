// Problem Agitation: A crucial, yet overlooked, component for a landing page that sells.
// It goes under your Hero section, and above your Features section.
// Your Hero section makes a promise to the customer: "Our product will help you achieve XYZ".
// Your Problem section explains what happens to the customer if its problem isn't solved.
// The copy should NEVER mention your product. Instead, it should dig the emotional outcome of not fixing a problem.
// For instance:
// - Hero: "ShipFast helps developers launch startups fast"
// - Problem Agitation: "Developers spend too much time adding features, get overwhelmed, and quit." (not about ShipFast at all)
// - Features: "ShipFast has user auth, Stripe, emails all set up for you"
