    question: "How does AI tutoring help children learn 2x faster than traditional school?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>This approach is based on 40+ years of learning science research, particularly Benjamin Bloom&#39;s 2 Sigma Problem, which found that students with 1:1 AI tutoring perform two standard deviations better than traditional classroom students.</p>
        <p>Traditional classrooms can&#39;t provide personalized learning or true mastery-based education. Our AI tutors can. When children get adaptive learning instruction at their exact level and master each concept before moving on, they naturally learn much faster.</p>
        <p>Our MAP test scores prove it: children average in the 99th percentile nationally across all subjects. These are standardized tests taken by millions—the results are real and verified.</p>

    question: "But what about socialization without traditional classrooms?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Timeback children are actually MORE social than traditional school students, not less.</p>
        <p>Think about it—in traditional school, kids sit quietly in rows for 6+ hours. With Timeback, they finish academics by lunch and spend 4+ hours in group activities: sports teams, drama clubs, robotics, debate, and real collaborative projects.</p>
        <p>Instead of rushed 20-minute recesses, they have genuine time to build deep friendships through shared interests. Parents consistently report their kids are happier and have stronger social skills than before.</p>

    question: "How does AI-powered homeschool curriculum work without traditional teachers?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>We don&#39;t have traditional teachers lecturing at the front of a classroom—we have something better: AI tutors combined with human Guides who mentor and motivate.</p>
        <p>Each child works with a personalized AI tutor that provides adaptive 1:1 instruction, instantly identifying and addressing learning gaps. The AI never gets frustrated, never judges, and adapts perfectly to each child&#39;s learning pace and style.</p>
        <p>Our human Guides focus on what humans do best: inspiring, encouraging, and helping students develop as whole people. They&#39;re there for emotional support, motivation, and ensuring every child becomes a confident, self-driven learner in our homeschool environment.</p>

    question: "Is this right for my child?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Timeback works beautifully for 80-90% of children. It&apos;s especially transformative for:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Bright kids who are bored and unchallenged in traditional school</li>
          <li>Children who&apos;ve fallen behind and need to catch up</li>
          <li>Children who learn at a different pace than the classroom average</li>
          <li>Kids who want time for serious pursuits (sports, arts, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key requirement? A motivated child and parents who believe their kids are capable of more than the traditional system allows. If you&apos;re reading this, that&apos;s probably you.</p>

  {
    question: "What are the actual results?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Let the data speak for itself:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                  <li>Average child scores in the 99th percentile on MAP tests</li>
        <li>Children who were 2 years behind caught up in 6 months</li>
          <li>High schoolers average 1470+ on SATs</li>
          <li>Graduates accepted to Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, and other top universities</li>
          <li>90% of children say they LOVE school (compared to national average of 20%)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These aren&apos;t cherry-picked success stories. This is our average. Every child deserves to reach their full potential—Timeback just makes it possible.</p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my child is actually learning?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>You&apos;ll have more visibility into your child&apos;s education than ever before. Our parent dashboard shows:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Real-time progress in every subject</li>
          <li>Exact grade level placement (many parents discover their &quot;on-track&quot; child is actually behind)</li>
          <li>Daily learning efficiency metrics</li>
          <li>MAP test results three times per year</li>
          <li>Time spent on each subject and concept mastery rates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No more wondering what &quot;B+&quot; actually means. You&apos;ll see exactly what your child knows, where they&apos;re excelling, and where they need support—updated daily.</p>
