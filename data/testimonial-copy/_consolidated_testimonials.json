I actually don't have teachers. I learned from my computer using apps so far this year. I've already learned double than I would in normal school. Technically, two-point tricks. I like math because of the content. I like challenges and sometimes math can be a way harder than reading. Because like in reading, you have to memorize vocabulary and stuff which is pretty easy to memorize. I love a challenge so whenever I work in my math apps, I'm never bored.",

Whenever I was reading, I got stuck a lot and it was tough. At Alpha, I actually don't have a teacher. I learn from apps every single day. My reading app is great because when I get something wrong, it helps me figure out why I got it wrong. At a normal school, I would have grown 1x this year. But Alpha, the year's not over. And I've already grown 2.6x. That's double what I would at a normal school. I don't have to stick just a second grade. I can learn third and fourth grade content too.",
