  "originalTranscription": "Hi, I'm 6 years old and I go to Alpha. Every day, I use apps to learn. When I get scared, I use my tools to help me. I have to be independent and to focus. I work for 25 minutes on each app. When working, I'm super independent. Guess how much I grew so far this year? 4.5x in reading. 5.6x in math. Alpha is awesome because I'm learning how to learn. Not everybody learns this fast. But that's okay, some kids need more time. At Alpha, I don't have to go slow. I can work at my own pace.",
