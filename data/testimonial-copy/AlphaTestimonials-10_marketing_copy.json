  "originalTranscription": "I love Alpha because, even though I'm second grade, I've mastered all the second grade skills. My apps let me learn fourth grade content. I actually don't have teachers. I learned from my computer using apps so far this year. I've already learned double than I would in normal school. Technically, two-point tricks. I like math because of the content. I like challenges and sometimes math can be a way harder than reading. Because like in reading, you have to memorize vocabulary and stuff which is pretty easy to memorize. I love a challenge so whenever I work in my math apps, I'm never bored.",
