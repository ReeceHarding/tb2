Whenever I was reading, I got stuck a lot and it was tough. At Alpha, I actually don't have a teacher. I learn from apps every single day. My reading app is great because when I get something wrong, it helps me figure out why I got it wrong. At a normal school, I would have grown 1x this year. But Alpha, the year's not over. And I've already grown 2.6x. That's double what I would at a normal school. I don't have to stick just a second grade. I can learn third and fourth grade content too.",
