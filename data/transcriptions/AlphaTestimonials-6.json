The app just explains how to do it correctly. That way I can learn from my mistakes. You're not going to believe this but it's true. I grew 8 apps in reading. As I keep mastering new skills I get to level up. Some kids don't learn this fast but that's okay. Alpha everybody learns at their own pace. Guess what? I also grew 4 apps in the back. I like Alpha because I get to bring home like a computer.",
