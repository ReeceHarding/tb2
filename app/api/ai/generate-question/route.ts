CHILD'S PROFILE:
- Grade Level: ${gradeLevel}
- Interests: ${interests.join(', ')}
- Quiz Data: ${JSON.stringify(quizData)}

EXISTING QUESTIONS TO AVOID (create something different):
${existingQuestions.map((q: string) => `- ${q}`).join('\n')}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a question that feels personally relevant to their child's specific situation
2. The question should explore a unique aspect of TimeBack not covered by existing questions
3. Make it conversational and parent-focused (not academic)
4. Focus on outcomes, benefits, or practical implementation
5. Keep it under 12 words and make it actionable
6. Use plain text only - no special formatting

GOOD EXAMPLES:
- "How would this work for my shy ${gradeLevel} grader?"
- "What if my child struggles with ${interests[0]}?"
- "Could this help with my child's ${interests[0]} passion?"
- "How do you handle kids who hate traditional school?"
- "What does success look like for ${gradeLevel} students?"

YOUR TASK:
Generate ONE personalized exploration question that would be genuinely helpful for this parent to explore. The question should feel like something they would naturally want to ask about their specific child.

Respond with ONLY the question text - no quotes, no formatting, no explanation. Just the question.`;
