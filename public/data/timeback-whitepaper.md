# Executive Summary
## Transforming Classrooms & Unlocking Potential with AI-Powered Mastery Learning

In today's fast-paced world, traditional education systems are increasingly failing children. The current approach is outdated, filled with busy work, and often a colossal waste of time. Enter **TimeBack**—a transformative model that empowers students to crush academics in just 2 hours a day and learn 2x the material (supported by ~6x faster learning rates) with AI-driven personalized education, freeing up 4 hours to develop life skills and explore interests. Our students don’t just survive school— they thrive and love every second of it.

Innovated by MacKenzie Price, **TimeBack** is redefining and revolutionizing the classroom. We utilize adaptive technology to provide coursework at the right level and the right motivation to foster a self-driven learning environment.

This is the future of education.

### Key Highlights:
*   **Personalized, Mastery-Based Learning:** Each student embarks on a tailored, mastery-based academic journey, ensuring deep understanding, fostering long-term retention, and eliminating learning gaps.
*   **The Gift of Time:** With only two hours required to crush academics, students have their afternoons to develop life skills such as leadership, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, and more, through hands-on activities.
*   **Guiding the Way:** There are no academic teachers; Guides motivate and support students as they become self-driven learners.
*   Data from Alpha School, the pioneer of **TimeBack**, showcases our extraordinary outcomes and phenomenal results. The truth is clear: Children can learn 2x the material in just 2 hours a day compared to 6 hours in a traditional school.

### Key Disclaimers:
*   **Not Just EdTech:** This model isn't a mere magic software solution. It is a comprehensive system in which student motivation is the key to 90% of success.
*   **Suitability:** While **TimeBack** works for 80-90% of children, it may not be suitable for everyone.

### Phenomenal Results:
*   **Standardized Test Performance:** This spring’s MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) results show that students averaged in the top 1-2% for every subject.
*   **2x Learning Measurement:** Students at Alpha outpace their peers in traditional school by at least 2x.
*   **Segmentation by Achievement:**
    *   **Advanced Students:** Excel beyond their age grade into the highest knowledge grade, often ranking in the top 10% nationally at that level.
    *   **Students Falling Behind:** Rapidly advance by closing significant knowledge gaps with the help of AI tutors. For example, seven boys who were two years behind advanced 13.8 times faster, completing two entire grade levels in just six months.
    *   **Low-SES Students:** Achieve learning rates 6.3 times faster, demonstrating the model's effectiveness across diverse backgrounds.
*   **Performance Based on Age:**
    *   **Primary and Middle Schoolers:** Thrive with a balanced schedule of intense academics and afternoon activities. On average they learn at least 6x faster, the top 2/3rds blaze through at 7.8x, and the top 20% rocket ahead at nearly 12x.
    *   **Kindergarteners:** At first, they were assumed to be too young for TimeBack, but they have surpassed expectations, with most students ranking in the top 1% by year-end.
    *   **High Schoolers:** Their impressive SAT (average 1470+) and AP scores (4s & 5s) have earned them acceptances at prestigious universities (Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, etc.)
*   **Academic Engagement and Efficiency:**
    *   Despite the rigorous academic outcomes, students are absolutely not burnt out. In fact, they end up spending less than 2 hours a day on academics, because they can efficiently and effectively master their subjects.

### How TimeBack Works:
We’re able to transform cutting-edge learning science (like Bloom’s 2 Sigma theory) into action by eliminating the traditional teacher-led classroom approach. AI tutors provide personalized learning plans to bolster strengths and address areas of improvement immediately – a mastery-based approach. Our Guides give students the support they need to tackle any challenges, adopt a growth mindset, and become self-driven learners – individualized attention. This departure from convention results in exceptional academic achievements, time for life skills, and happier students.

### Tactical Insights:
Students complete grade levels in significantly less time, as our tech can identify exactly where they are faltering and fix it. With 30-minute lessons + AI-recommended corrective sessions, they efficiently finish a grade in 80 days, achieving rapid advancement and deep mastery.

### Addressing Potential Issues:
However, there will be a few cases where our model will not work for your child. There are three reasons why this may happen:
*   **Material Too Hard:** Students must master foundational skills before progressing to advanced material. Our program includes lessons and time to memorize them as the quickest path forward is by going back to the basics.
*   **Lack of Engagement:** Unless students engage with the apps, they cannot progress – especially if they misuse or refuse them. Our Guides tackle this, providing constant motivation and support to help students.
*   **Parental Alignment:** Philosophical alignment between parents and the **TimeBack** model is imperative for student success. It's crucial for parents to understand how it works and see the results so they can decide if this is the right fit.

### Daily Learning Processes:
A **TimeBack** day includes four focused 25-minute sessions on core subjects, with additional time for math strategies and breaks. This ensures a comprehensive education and afternoons for life skills.

### Student Experience:
Students use adaptive apps that deliver tailored learning paths coupled with auditory and visual supplements. The Dash dashboard is used for tracking progress, setting goals, and hitting daily targets. AI tutors keep students sharp, using Speed Bumps and Struggle Detectors to smash through challenges.

### Parental Monitoring and Insights:
90% of parents believe their child is at grade level, while standardized tests show that less than 50% actually are. This is why we measure progress consistently and give parents access to detailed data, including MAP results and daily learning efficiency. Metric-oriented parents value this, as it provides unparalleled insight.

### Conclusion:
**TimeBack** goes beyond the classroom to nurture lifelong learners and leaders. By crushing their academics in just 2 hours a day, students have more time to develop essential life skills, pursue passions, and truly grow as people. Our model revolutionizes education, unlocking the limitless potential of every child.

# Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, the traditional school system is increasingly failing children. It's outdated, laden with busy work, and often a colossal waste of time. Now, in contrast, imagine a school where students focus on academics for only 2 hours a day and still outperform their peers in traditional schools. A place where they love to go and where they crush academics. Classrooms that have no teachers; instead, students learn academics through an AI tutor on apps, providing each student with a 1:1, mastery-based academic journey and guaranteeing success.

My name is MacKenzie Price, and I’m the co-founder of **TimeBack**—a revolutionary new learning model transforming education as we know it. It focuses on providing the right coursework tailored to each student’s needs and ensuring the right motivation to foster a self-driven learning environment. Here’s what powers it:

*   **Personalized, Mastery-Based Learning:** Each student receives a tailored academic journey that ensures they master each topic before moving on.
*   **The Gift Of Time:** Students spend only 2 hours a day on academics, freeing up the rest of the day for other enriching activities.
*   **Holistic Development:** Beyond academics, the model emphasizes the development of life skills such as leadership, teamwork, public speaking, financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and socialization through engaging workshops. Students engage in active, hands-on activities to develop these critical life skills.

This document delves into how **TimeBack** works and the remarkable academic results it delivers. Data from Alpha School, the first campus to implement TimeBack, demonstrates that children can learn 2x the material in just 2 hours a day compared to 6 hours in a traditional school.

## Key Disclaimers

Before diving into the details, it's essential to address a couple of key points:

*   **Not Just EdTech:** **TimeBack** is not magic software. Edtech constitutes only 10% of the solution, while 90% depends on having a motivated student. There are no academic teachers; Guides motivate and support students as they become self-driven learners. Additionally, by giving students their most valuable resource—time—back, they can spend the rest of the school day developing life skills through engaging workshops.
*   **Suitability:** This system works excellently for 80-90% of children - more on that later.

# The Concept of TimeBack

The **TimeBack** model is a revolutionary approach that enables students to excel at academics in just 2 hours daily. Powered by AI-personalized learning apps and Guides in place of teachers, this model adapts to each student's needs and pace, ensuring they're challenged at the right level and given the right kind of support. With adaptive AI technology pinpointing exactly what students know and don't know, they achieve mastery over concepts at least 6x faster. This opens up 4 hours for pursuing passions and developing crucial life skills, which motivates them to look forward to learning.

# Unveiling the Phenomenal Results

The results of **TimeBack** are extraordinary, often coming across as ‘too good to be true’ and leading to skepticism. It’s imperative to address these doubts. Here's a detailed explanation:

## Standardized Test Performance

MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) is a nationwide standardized test taken by millions of students. MAP holds **TimeBack** accountable for K-8, and SAT/AP tests are used for high school. The report for the 2023/24 school year, showing how we did at each grade level and in each subject, is given below.

**(Fig.1: Grade-level/subject MAP reports showing student scores across the board)**

**Alpha Austin – Language Arts Reading (Spring 2024)**

**Alpha Austin – Science: Science K–12 (Spring 2024)**
| Grade | Achievement Percentile | School Conditional Growth Percentile |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| K | 99 | 30 |

> **Notes:**
> - "Alpha students are in the top 1% nationwide."
> - "Alpha students are learning an average of 7.41x faster."
> - "5 out of 9 grades are in the 85th percentile."

If you look at the Spring achievement column, which measures how much students know, you can see that most of our classes are in the top 1% for every subject.

**(Fig.2: Aggregated Grade-level/subject MAP scores)**

The average student learns at least **6x faster**.
*   **Top 2/3rd:** 7.8x faster.
*   **Top 20%:** Nearly 12x faster.

# How is 2x learning Measured?

This is a common question that we receive. As mentioned, MAP is the third-party grader, measuring how much students learn each year. At Alpha, these scores are always doubled. For example, looking at the NWEA MAP Math Student Achievement Percentiles for 2020 below, a 50th percentile 5th grader typically goes up 4 points in math over a year. At Alpha, that student will go up 8 points. Similarly, a 99th percentile 7th grader goes up 7 points in traditional settings but 14 points at Alpha.

**(Fig.3 & Fig.4: MAP Student Achievement Percentiles)**

The grid below is for all grades/all percentiles – here is the report for an individual student:

**Individual Student Report – Achievement and Growth**
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Growth Percentile | 81 |
| Achievement Percentile | 96 |
| Quadrant | High Growth, High Achievement |
| Conditional Growth Index | 0.86 |
| Projected Growth (RIT) | +5 |
| Observed Growth (RIT) | +11 |

MAP tests are conducted three times annually, providing benchmarks to monitor and track students' academic progress and growth throughout the school year. We make sure that students are on the right track, learning 2x, and parents hold us accountable to deliver these results.

# Segmentation by Achievement

Segmenting the MAP data reveals stellar performance across different cohorts. This first one is by achievement. The average student learns at least 6x faster, the top 2/3rds blaze through at 7.8x faster, and the top 20%? They're rocketing ahead at nearly 12x the speed.

**(Fig.5: Learning outcomes for top 20%, middle 2/3rd, and all students, respectively)**

**Summary Multipliers (Learning Speed vs. Traditional School)**
| Group | Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- |
| Top 20% | 3.9x |
| Top 2/3rd | 2.6x |
| All students | 2.2x |

## Performance Across Student Groups

### Advanced Students
Advanced students often feel unstimulated and bored in traditional schools, losing interest when not challenged, stunting their growth and potential. Being gifted, then, does not seem like much of a gift. At Alpha, **TimeBack** allows kids to excel beyond their age grade, placing them in the highest knowledge grade at which they are placing in the top 10% nationally. Here are some real results, showing students’ age grade versus their knowledge grade, based on NWEA MAP scores.

**(Fig.6: Advanced students’ age grade versus their knowledge grade based on NWEA MAP scores)**

**Alpha Top 1% – Age Grade vs. Knowledge Grade at 90% Achievement**
| Subject | Average Age Grade | Average Knowledge Grade at 90% Achievement |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Language | 6.9 | 10.5 |
| Math | 3.0 | 5.0 |
| Reading | 1.6 | 3.0 |
| Science | 6.3 | 9.1 |

These results are unbelievable to most parents, but the truth is clear: Your children are capable of so much more than they get to do in traditional school. They just aren't given the right challenge and motivation. With an AI tutor, students can move as fast as they are capable of learning – the sky’s the limit!!

### Students Falling Behind
On the other hand, some children are lagging behind. Parents and students are both unaware of significant knowledge gaps that the student has that will only snowball. These kids may not even know what they don't know, so how can they fix it? Our model excels at taking children who are behind and enabling them to catch up. With AI tutors that are adept at identifying and addressing these gaps, kids rapidly advance, smashing through their academic barriers like never before.

Here are the results from a group of 7 boys who were 2 years behind and needed help. Within just 6 months, they learned 4.6x and completed 2 entire grade levels!

**(Fig.8: Students catching up rapidly using AI tutors)**

**Growth vs. Standard School – Esports Students (Winter to Spring)**
| Cohort | Term | Growth Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Esports Students | Spring 2022–2023 | 1.3x |
| Esports Students | Spring 2023–2024 | 4.7x |

### Low-SES Students
Alpha has a campus in Brownsville, TX, which has one of the poorest school districts in the country, and the students there learned 6.3x faster. Here is the thing about an AI Tutor: it doesn’t care if a student is white, black, or brown. It doesn’t care if a student is rich or poor. It doesn’t care if a student is in the 15th percentile or the 85th. It is infinitely patient and steadfastly goal-oriented toward mastery.

**(Fig.9: Low-SES students’ accelerated pace of learning)**

**Low SES Students – 2nd Grade Reading Percentile Change**
| Season | Percentile |
| :--- | :---: |
| Winter 2023 | 31 |
| Winter 2024 | 71 |

**Low SES Students – 2nd Grade Math Percentile Change**
| Season | Percentile |
| :--- | :---: |
| Winter 2023 | 31 |
| Winter 2024 | 84 |

# Performance Based On Age

### Primary and Middle Schoolers
Middle schoolers at Alpha School thrive like never before. Bolstered by the streamlined academic schedule, they crush their studies in the morning and have the entire afternoon to dive into their passions and develop life skills. This combination of intense academics and ample free time skyrockets their performance. What’s even more amazing is that over 90% of Alpha students didn't just say they liked school—they said they loved it!

**(Fig.10: Concentration of students per percentiles based on the MAP score)**
> The MAP Achievement Percentile Distribution for Spring 23–24 shows a student concentration heavily skewed toward the 90–100th percentile band, with very few students falling below the 50th percentile.

Grade,Language,Math,Reading,Science
0,,99,99,
1,,99,99,
2,99,99,99,99
3,99,96,99,99
4,99,94,99,99
5,99,99,99,99
6,99,99,99,99

9,99,99,99,99
10,99,99,99,99
11,99,98,99,99


### Kindergarteners
When we started Alpha, we didn't offer a Kindergarten class because we assumed that they were too young to learn via apps. We were proven wrong – our youngest learners excelled in this environment. As you can see in their MAP scores below, almost all students are in the top 1% by year-end.

**(Fig.12: All Kindergarten MAP Scores)**
> All Kindergarten MAP scores for Alpha Austin in Spring 2023–2024 show a strong concentration in the top right quadrant, indicating high achievement and high growth.

### High Schoolers
The focus is usually on Kindergarten through 8th grade, but let’s talk a little bit about high school. These students have been using **TimeBack** the longest, some without an academic teacher for 10 years.

In high school, MAP isn't the key metric. Instead, SAT and Advanced Placement tests lead the way. The results? An average SAT score of 1470+ and over 90% of students scoring 4’s or 5’s on APs. Alongside this, they are still able to undertake and complete Olympic-level Masterpiece Projects that teach them real-world skills.

Colleges could not get enough of these self-driven learners! This year, the first graduating class of Alpha High secured spots at Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, UCL (London), NYU Shanghai, The University of Texas (Honors), University of Austin, Howard, Northeastern, and FIT. Half were National Merit Scholars or Commended Scholars, with five being AP Scholars with Distinction Highest Honor.

**(Fig.13: Chart of high school students' SAT scores in comparison to the national average)**

**Comparison of SAT Average Scores**
| Group | Average SAT Score |
| :--- | :---: |
| Alpha High School | 1474 |
| National Average | 1028 |

# Academic Engagement and Efficiency

These academic results across K-12 are amazing – so amazing that the next thought is, "Wow, you must exhaust these kids out with tons of class time and tons of homework!”

## Daily Academic Hours
So, are Alpha students burnt out? Not in the slightest. On average, they spend less than 2 hours a day on academics. Here’s the proof: A graph showing the actual number of hours that Alpha students spend each day on their academics.

**(Fig.15: The number of hours students spend each day on academics.)**

**Alpha Students – Hours of Study per Day for All Subjects (SY 23–24)**
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Average Hours of Study per School Day | 1.8 |
| Maximum Hours Observed | ~3.0 |
| Minimum Hours Observed | ~0.1 |

As you can see, the average is less than 2 hours a day. Some students go over 2 hours, but not a single one exceeds 3. Those putting in extra time are either catching up or surging ahead— taking full control of their learning journey. These students aren't just getting by; they're efficiently and effectively mastering their subjects.

At this point, we’re met with jaw-slacked, wide-eyed disbelief: How can they learn and do so much in such little time? Our experience as parents and the schooling we went through makes this seem unthinkable, but it is most definitely possible, bringing us to…

# Why TimeBack Works

Our remarkable results in just 2 hours a day are achieved by leveraging learning science and eliminating the traditional teacher-in-front-of-classroom model. This has been a 10-year process since the very first school opened in 2014, and while it is presented as a polished model, it remains an evolving system. The **TimeBack** model is leading-edge, and parents should expect excellent outcomes, not perfection. Nevertheless, even if there are hiccups with the technology or the tech glitches, we always deliver results.

## Learning Science and Pedagogy
Thousands of learning science papers have been written about how students can best learn. Benjamin Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem is a seminal paper published over four decades ago. All of these papers describe how students can learn 2x, 5x, or even 10x faster. But here's the kicker—they all start or end with "this doesn't work in a standard teacher-in-front-of-a-classroom model.”

The **TimeBack** model is grounded in extensive learning science research, especially Bloom's findings, which show that students can learn significantly faster with personalized approaches. As traditional classroom models cannot replicate these results, we make sure nothing about our model is conventional, and that’s the core of how we work and succeed.

We have removed the teacher from the front of the classroom. No one has ever dared to do this before. Imagine starting a school and declaring, "We won't have any academic teachers." We did exactly that! Hundreds of Alpha Austin parents made their kids pioneers in this bold experiment over the past 10 years, and because of their courage, your child can now benefit from this groundbreaking approach.

Let’s take two learning science examples from Bloom's 2 sigma paper.

### Individualized Tutoring and Learning Plans
Example #1 of why the teacher-in-front-of-the-classroom model doesn't work.

**Classroom Diversity in Knowledge:** 80% of a standard classroom does not have the same background knowledge, especially post-COVID. Some students are behind, some are at grade level, and some are ahead, so teachers have no choice but to teach the ‘middle’ – the average.

**(Fig.17: A visualization of the spread of scores in one grade)**
> A boxplot of 7th/8th grader math scores from Fall 2022 shows a wide variation, with the median score at the 7th-grade level, but with outliers as low as 2nd grade and as high as 12th grade.

A teacher can't possibly give individual lessons to each kid, but an AI tutor can. It is not confined to the standard limitations.

**Case Study:** We had a new 8th grader join the school who was behind academically, though she and her parents didn’t realize the extent of the issue – a common occurrence. If placed in 8th-grade material based on her age, it would have been overwhelming and demoralizing. Instead, the AI tutor assessed her needs and started her with 5th-grade material. This precise placement and individualized learning plan boosted her confidence and proved she could learn. With just one extra hour of work, she quickly advanced. By the end of her first year at Alpha, she was academically ready for high school, saving her years of struggle.

### Mastery-Based Learning
Example #2 of why the teacher-in-front-of-the-classroom model doesn't work.

Mastery learning is a game-changing concept: Don't put students in material that is over their heads, and if they haven't mastered the basics, they do not attempt the advanced. But for this to work, students need to be given all the time they need to nail the material. Unfortunately, traditional classrooms can't ever handle this.

Teachers must stick to the lesson plan, moving on to new concepts as the school year progresses. If students don't fully understand, there’s not much that can be done about it. This approach leaves students with any learning gaps at all struggling in advanced lessons at some point or another. If you can't ace 70% of division problems, you'll be lost in fractions, which demand mastery of division and multiplication, and even if you understand 90% at one point, the remaining 10% can still snowball down the line.

Unless students have grasped 100% of the lesson, they are not ‘okay’ to move on to the next concept. Given below are the consequences of what happens when this is allowed: the average high school senior scores the same on a nationwide standardized test as the best 3rd grader.

**(Fig.18: Conceptual discrepancies across grade levels)**
> A comparison of Spring Mathematics Student Achievement Percentiles shows that a 99th percentile 3rd grader and a 50th percentile 12th grader can have the same RIT score (234), indicating the average senior performs at the level of the best 3rd grader.

That’s the learning science behind **TimeBack** and our success. With AI Tutors, students get individualized plans tailored to their pace and level of knowledge, ensuring they achieve true mastery before moving on, giving them clarity and encouragement. Now, let’s dive into the detailed aspects.

| 3 | 45 | 11 | 12 |
| 4 | 39 | 18 | 17 |
| 5 | 49 | 13 | 15 |
| 6 | 51 | 15 | 18 |

| 8 | 39 | 14 | 13 |
| **Avg** | **41** | **11** | **12** |

**Breakdown:** 3rd-grade language has ~100 lessons, averaging 16 minutes per lesson, totaling 40 hours. Now, you might pick up on the fact that it should only take about 25 hours, not 40. So why the difference?

Well, when students get stuck, the AI Struggle Detector steps in, identifying when a student is facing challenges and providing additional targeted or easier lessons to address these difficulties. Students thus end up doing more than the minimum number of lessons. Plus, there are days when students might not be fully focused—they’re messing around, distracted, or just not feeling it.

On average, they can complete the entire grade level in 40 hours. Let’s break that down. If they used 1-hour classes, they’d finish in less than 2 months. We use 30-minute sessions, so it takes 80 days to finish.

With 180 school days in the year, a student needs to finish a grade in 90 days if they’re going to complete 2 grades in one year. 80 days fits comfortably within that 90-day window, allowing for test days and absences. Once they master 3rd grade, they move on to 4th grade for the second 90-day period, which has 93 lessons at 15 minutes each.

**(Fig. 20: Lessons per grade mastered over the course of 180 days)**
> A chart shows daily lessons mastered over 180 days, with a clear transition from Grade 3 to Grade 4 content around day 90, demonstrating the ability to complete two grade levels in one academic year.

So there you have it: This is how students can easily learn 2x as much in only 2 hours/day.

# Addressing Potential Issues

However, there will be a few cases where our model will not work for your child. There are three reasons why this may happen:

1.  **Material Too Hard:** If students don’t have the necessary Fast Math skills for advanced material, they will struggle. Without memorizing basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division tables, they can't progress in 2 hours. They must go back and master these basics first. In our program, students are given specific lessons and time to memorize them, often newly learning that the quickest path forward is by going back to solidify foundational skills.
2.  **Lack of Engagement:** The system fails if students don't engage with the app. If they refuse to use it or misuse it (e.g., typing random letters into math problems), it indicates a motivation issue. This is what we have our Guides tackle. They spend their day motivating and emotionally supporting students, working tirelessly to find ways to keep them engaged.
3.  **Parental Alignment:** The most challenging aspect to overcome is when parents are not philosophically aligned with the **TimeBack** model. This misalignment can hinder student engagement. It's crucial for parents to understand how **TimeBack** works and see the results so they can decide if they support their child becoming a self-driven learner or prefer a traditional teacher-led approach.

# Daily Learning Processes

Another question we get asked is about what a day in the life of a **TimeBack** student looks like. At Alpha, the structure of the 120 minutes is as follows:

*   **4 Sessions of 25 Minutes Each:** Utilizing the Pomodoro technique, students engage in focused 25-minute sessions dedicated to Math, Science (& Social Science), Language (& Writing), and Reading.
*   **Additional 20 Minutes:** This time is primarily devoted to Math but also includes vital learning concepts such as learning strategies, test-taking techniques, and Depth of Knowledge (DOK) exercises.
*   **Incorporating Breaks:** The 2-hour schedule includes necessary breaks and recess to keep students refreshed and engaged.
*   **Balanced Subject Time:** Science and Language occupy roughly half the time allocated to Math and Reading. Once students complete their Science and Language material, they transition to History, Social Science, and additional writing lessons, ensuring holistic education.

After this, they have their afternoons to engage with their passions, delve into interests, and learn valuable life skills.

**(Fig.21: 120 Minutes with TimeBack)**

**Allocation of 120 Minutes in TimeBack Block**
| Category | Minutes Allocated |
| :--- | :---: |
| Math | 25 |
| Science & Social Science | 25 |
| Language & Writing | 25 |
| Reading | 25 |
| Additional Learning Concepts | 20 |

# Student Experience

When academic sessions are underway, students use an individual dashboard called **Dash** to manage their learning, which ensures:

*   **Visual Progress Tracking:** The student can see a visual representation of the lessons remaining in their grade level. The Jenga tower illustrates the subjects they have mastered and the ones still to be completed.
*   **Goal Setting:** Students can set long-term goals and see how these impact their daily objectives. This feature fosters a sense of ownership and control over their learning journey. (Parents also have access to this information.)
*   **Daily Completion Check:** The Daily Rings feature allows students to easily check if they have finished their daily work, providing immediate feedback and motivation.

## The Apps
Take a look at our application interfaces. During **TimeBack**, students work in adaptive apps tailored to each subject. These apps match the student’s exact level and pace while offering various ways to present information, including auditory and video supplements. This approach is especially beneficial for younger learners and students with learning differences.

The AI tutor guides students on how to use the apps to learn, helping them when they encounter challenges. It is constantly assessing and monitoring how a student is progressing through their lessons via **Speed Bumps** and **Struggle Detector**.

# How Do Parents Know What’s Going On?

## Parental Monitoring and Insights
One of the major advantages of using an AI tutor is the access to incredibly detailed data on what your child knows and doesn't know, far surpassing traditional school metrics. Trusting teachers and schools to self-grade often leads to rampant grade inflation. In fact, 90% of parents believe their child is at grade level, while standardized tests show that less than 50% actually are. Parents are frequently shocked by the low PSAT/SAT scores of their "A" students and end up hiring tutors to compensate, often discovering these issues too late.

### Learning Plan
The learning plan available to each parent and student at Alpha is updated daily. Think of it as a CAT scan, providing a detailed view of what your child knows and where there are gaps.

**(Fig.26: Learning Plan Screen Image)**

**Placement and Progress Summary**
| Subject | Age Grade | Knowledge Grade | % Grade Completed | Weeks to Complete |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Language | 5 | 4 | 88% | 10 |
| Science | 6 | 5 | 87% | 1 |
| Math | 6 | 4 | 100% | 0 |
| Reading | 5 | 5 | 100% | 0 |

**Key Learning Metrics Summary**
| Subject | Lesson Completion Target | Lessons Mastered | Growth Prediction |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Language | 73% | 63 | 1x → 2x |
| Math | 115% | 154 | 2x |
| Reading | 111% | 72 | 2x |
| Science | 128% | 46 | 2x |

| Subject | Daily Minutes / School Day | Daily Minutes vs Target |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Language | 27 | 109% |
| Math | 49 | 198% |
| Reading | 21 | 85% |
| Science | 15 | 58% |
| **Total** | **112** | **112%** |

> **Waste Percentage:** 10%
> **Accuracy Benchmarks:** <80% = Too Hard, 80–90% = Ideal, >95% = Ready for More

First up, the MAP results show the student’s percentile achievement measuring how much they know compared to their peers. They also show percentile growth, indicating how fast they are learning. Times growth compares their learning speed to that of students in traditional schools, aiming for 6x faster learning.

Next, we have standardized tests that demonstrate mastery of a grade level. These tests vary by location—Texas uses the STAAR test, and Florida uses the FAST test. We are also adding national tests like the ISEE and SSAT for benchmarking. To finish a grade level, students must score 90% on these tests, a mastery standard far higher than state or standard school requirements.

The final section focuses on learning efficiency, which is critical for teaching kids to learn in just 2 hours a day.

1.  **We track the number of minutes per day.** This shows how many minutes a student spends on each subject daily and their "% to target"—whether they’re spending more or less time than required. Typically, this is 25 minutes per subject per day.
2.  **Then, we move on to accuracy.** This quality control check ensures effective learning. If a student consistently scores above 95%, the material is too easy. If they score below 70%, it’s too hard, or they’re guessing.
3.  **Lastly, we have the WASTE meter**—which tracks the percentage of time a student is wasting. Our AI tutor monitors whether the student is using the apps correctly. This includes being present at the computer, entering meaningful answers, reading explanations, and avoiding random guessing. Proper app usage is essential to finishing academics in just 2 hours a day. Students spending more than 2 hours often have high WASTE scores above 50%.

Metric-oriented parents value this screen as it provides unparalleled insight into what their child knows and doesn't know, a level of detail unavailable in traditional classroom settings. Comprehensive insight allows parents to understand their child's academic strengths and areas needing improvement in real time, fostering a more proactive and involved approach to education. This transparency and data-driven methodology ensure that each student receives the personalized support they need to thrive.
